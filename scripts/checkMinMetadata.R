# check minimal metadata

# check if the dataframes have information on
# - latitude and longitude (needed to see latitudinal gradient) - given either in lat_lon, latitude + longitude,
# - marine region (e.g. which are all from the north atlantic? - can also be calculated later) - given as geo_loc_name
# - collection_date and time (what time of the year was it, can use to determine seasons)
# - size fractionation (essential to know what organisms to expect)
# - layer (did they target a deep chlorophyll maximum?)
# - temperature
# - salinity
# 
# - sequencing technique
# 
# Information I know won't be there, but I would like
# - coastal VS open ocean
# - upwelling system or non-upwelling system
# - consistent marine regions
