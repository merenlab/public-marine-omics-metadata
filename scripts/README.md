# A directory for ad-hoc scripts and workflows to acquire metadata

Background information

## scripts

### 1. `ENAmetadataKingfisherDownload.sh`

Here, we are using `Kingfisher` to download metadata from ENA and NCBI.

Woodcroft, B. J., Cunningham, M., Gans, J. D., Bolduc, B. B., & Hodgkins, S. B. (2024). Kingfisher: A utility for procurement of public sequencing data (v0.4.0). Zenodo. https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10525086
Doc: https://wwood.github.io/kingfisher-download/
GitHub: https://github.com/wwood/kingfisher-download

To use it, you need to install Kingfisher and use conda env (see installation guide https://wwood.github.io/kingfisher-download/)
```
conda create -n kingfisher -c conda-forge -c bioconda kingfisher
conda activate kingfisher
```

To run it, give it permissions (because it's an .sh script) and run it
```
chmod +x ENAmetadataKingfisherDownload.sh
./ENAmetadataKingfisherDownload.sh
```

### 2. `cleanKingfisherTARA.py`

Here, we are cleaning up the TARA dataframe. From the ones I downloaded this one seems to be the only one that make trouble.

Trouble: the values for some samples in this project were added using slightly different metadata keys
- the value for theoretically the same key is in different columns, for some the column key is upper case for others it is lowercase (e.g. temperature VS Temperature)
- values for `sample_description` sometimes being given under `sample_description`, other times as `description` (leaving the field under the other key blank)
- values for `sample_title` sometimes given under `sample_title`, other times as `title` (here, `sample_title` has values for all samples, however, whenever the `title` key has values, those are - for those samples - more appropriate than the ones given in `sample_title`, and they are consistent with the other values given in `sample_title`)

To run this script do:
```
python3 cleanKingfisherTARA.py
```
