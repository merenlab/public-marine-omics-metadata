# Purpose

Welcome to the Standardized Metadata Collection for Omics Data repository! This repository is dedicated to the collection, standardization, and sharing of metadata associated with various omics data types, currently focusing on metagenomics but with plans to expand to metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics, and metabolomics. 

Our goal is to present metadata in a standardized fashion, both semantically and syntactically, ensuring it is ready for analysis. We will provide guidance and examples to help others contribute. By pooling our efforts, we aim to avoid the duplication of work involved in preparing individual metadata sets and make the process more efficient, considering the significant amount of effort required for metadata preparation.

We are starting by providing the workflow we followed (see scripts/README.md) to get the metadata for the projects listed below as well as, of course sharing the final product.


# Metagenomomes

The purpose of this section list the metagenomes included in the current metadata curation effort. This includes the project name, (data) publication, date range, depth range, number of samples, number of runs, project accession number, and other relevant information about the projects and their metadata below.

For details of the metadata curation efforts that include the following datasets and publications that originally describe them see scripts/README.md

> [!NOTE]
Please note, that the current collection of curated metadata is limited to runs from the projects noted below that
- are metagenomes
- are paired-end
- are from samples collected in â‰¤100 m depth
- are from samples associated with at least environmental metadata on `temperature`

* Tara Oceans Project
* Ocean Sampling Day 2014
* Bio-GO-SHIP
* bioGEOTRACES
* Hawaii Ocean Time-Series ALOHA
* BATS
* Western Channel Observatory L4 Station
